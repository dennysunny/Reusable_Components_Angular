## Introduction

This Angular project serves as a collection of reusable shared components that can be easily integrated into your Angular applications. These components are designed to enhance the user interface and functionality of your web applications, providing a consistent and professional look and feel.

The following reusable components are included:

- **Accordion**: Create collapsible sections with ease.
- **Table**: Display data in a tabular format with sorting and filtering capabilities.
- **Input Box**: Enhance user input forms with various input styles.
- **Statistics**: Display data statistics in an organized and visually appealing way.
- **Description Box**: Provide informative descriptions with rich text and media support.
- **Modals**: Create modal dialogs for displaying additional information or actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using these shared components, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/angular-shared-components.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd angular-shared-components
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Each shared component can be used independently in your Angular application. Here's how to use them:

### Accordion

The Accordion component allows you to create collapsible sections. To use it, import the `AccordionModule` in your Angular module and use the `<app-accordion>` component in your HTML templates.

```html
<app-accordion [items]="accordionItems"></app-accordion>
```

### Table

The Table component is designed for displaying data in a tabular format. Import the `TableModule` in your Angular module and use the `<app-table>` component in your HTML templates.

```html
<app-table [data]="tableData" [columns]="tableColumns"></app-table>
```

### Input Box

Enhance your user input forms with different input styles using the Input Box component. Import the `InputBoxModule` in your Angular module and use the `<app-input-box>` component in your HTML templates.

```html
<app-input-box [type]="'text'" [placeholder]="'Enter text...'" [(ngModel)]="textValue"></app-input-box>
```

### Statistics

The Statistics component allows you to display data statistics in an organized way. Import the `StatisticsModule` in your Angular module and use the `<app-statistics>` component in your HTML templates.

```html
<app-statistics [data]="statisticsData"></app-statistics>
```

### Description Box

Provide informative descriptions with rich text and media support using the Description Box component. Import the `DescriptionBoxModule` in your Angular module and use the `<app-description-box>` component in your HTML templates.

```html
<app-description-box [text]="descriptionText"></app-description-box>
```

### Modals

Create modal dialogs for displaying additional information or actions with the Modals component. Import the `ModalsModule` in your Angular module and use the `<app-modal>` component in your HTML templates.

```html
<app-modal [title]="modalTitle" [content]="modalContent" (close)="onModalClose()"></app-modal>
```
